# Description
The portfolio website is a clean and minimal site to showcase certain skills and technology used. Built on a MERN stack which utilizes NoSQL using MongoDB to record the information submitted on the Contact Form, Express.js makes an API call and emails myself upon submission of a contact form, React is the primary framework used for front-end development, built on Node to handle it all. The site follows the MVC design pattern (Model-View-Controller) which is an development architecture style commonly used in software companies.
